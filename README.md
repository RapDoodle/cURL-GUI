# cURL-GUI
A simple GUI for curl (HTTP requests only). It was built with the help of [Form2Cmd](https://github.com/RapDoodle/Form2Cmd), a declarative programming framework that helps build graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for command-line-only applications. It converts form input into the appropriate command for the command line tool [cURL](https://curl.se/). An online version can be found [here](https://rapdoodle.github.io/form2cmd/curl/index.html).
